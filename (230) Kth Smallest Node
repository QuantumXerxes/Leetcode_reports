Kth Smallest Node 
Approach : 1
The first and foremost idea which scintillated inside my head after glancing over this question was to preserve all these elements in a queue and then iterating through that queue while keeping count such that when it equates to the int k , the function returns the node value. The inefficiency of this method relies in iterating through the whole queue and popping .

Approach : 2
Then without using any other Data Structure , I implemented another intution of this question with which the entire complexity allayed. The Depth first search inorder traversal reaches towards the leaf of the tree and then starts incrementing the count and checks whether the count is equal to int k , if it does the node is returned if it doesn't , checks whether the left is null and goes to the right child . 
Recursively , the block of code is much more efficient and condensed . 

Overall : I caricatured the tree on pen and paper , then checked for what I've to do and implemented it after visually going through steps , got stuck at recursion but eventually solved as intution of DFS hit me which applies inorder traversal.
