Longest Palindrome
Looks easy but has it's own way of confusing over combinations but we ain't supposed to find such kind of combinations.

The rule of palindrome says that the character existing must be in even indiviually or if they have odd frequency they can be added only once at the centre of the palindrome string to construct 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Hence a character occuring more than once should only be added in with it's even frequency that is (count/2*2 this and not the count-1 method because we store the characters in ASCII coded character array where some of the indexes will have 0 if their ascii code char is not present in string) . The result(total no of chrcters which can form palindrome) has to be even and if it's odd , the character with odd occurence is at the centre.
